## Abstract of the project

The application of the Information Integrated Farming model will mostly been seen when
farmers or inventory managers require to see how much land is occupied by who, growing what
as it gives us a diagrammatic representation of the same. It will help plan transportation and
also enable farmers to superficially observe and monitor all their crops/ land.


The Information Integrated Farming system aims at solving multiple issues. The first issue is
that of managing multiple plots of land and seeing where an individual plot is located. The next
is the lack of awareness of which crop is grown where and its specific quantity. Lastly, the
aggregate information to be shared with transportation/ storage facilities to see more
productivity.


The model is one that will include a map interface so we can accurately locate and display all
the plots as they are located in real life.
We also propose to create an interface that is user friendly and easy to use for the farmers and
other end users like farm managers, agriculture advisors, logistic contractors etc. This model
will contain a interface for different end users to make queries regarding parameters like
survey numbers, types of crop grown, irrigation type, soil type and view the result on a
interactive map.

We found that devising this type of a system can improve the total efficiency and productivity
of the farmers in managing their fields and help improve their knowledge through the system
and also in turn increasing the economic growth.
